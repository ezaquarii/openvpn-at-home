OpenVPN PKI stuff with **Vue.js**, **Semantic UI** and **Django**.
And with love, of course.

Brief
=====

Managing OpenVPN with PKI authentication is hard. Managing anything beyond hello-world using ``easy-rsa`` package
is a major issue - I could never maintain a config for more than a day. Other solutions are too *"enterprise"*
for a personal installation or were designed for a tin-foil hat, crypto maniacs hiding from NSA/GCHQ.

This app provides easy management console to keep OpenVPN configuration files in one place, provided in self-contained,
easily deployable, clickable package. It's not designed for security - it's meant just to be **good enough**.

And that works for me better than "no VPN at all".

Features:

#. users with admin/casual privilege separation
#. simple user registration
#. automatic generation of OpenVPN profiles
#. all crypto stuff is inlined into OpenVPN profiles
#. profiles can be sent by e-mail or downloaded as files

That's all folks. No fancy stuff. It's not a toolbox, it's a screwdriver to manage 3-5 home machines (and phones).

.. note:: This is a work-in-progress app, hacked together during x-mas break to solve a specific need of mine.
          Feel free to submit PRs with improvements.

Project structure
=================

The project is split into *backend* and *frontend*.

The backend is written in **Django** and **Django REST Framework**. The frontend is a **Vue.js** SPA application served by **Django**.
That division makes the build slightly more complicated, but provided *Makefiles* make it a breeze. It should just work.

Installation
============

Prerequisites
-------------

#. Working Node.js installation (tested with 9.2.1 & 9.3.0)
#. Python 3 with virtualenv
#. GNU Make (or compatible)
#. OpenVPN in ${PATH}
#. OpenSSL in ${PATH}
#. Internet connection (no off-line build possible)

Deployment
----------

For development
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After cloning the repository, you can deploy the app for development
with a single command:

::

    $ git clone https://github.com/ezaquarii/openvpn-at-home
    $ cd openvpnathome
    $ make devel
    ... backend is bootstrapped ...
    ... frontend is bootstrapped ...
    $ make runserver

Open ``http://localhost:8001/`` and you should be able to log-in.

For production
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Production deployment is supported on *Ubuntu*. *Debian* should be supported, but I didn't test it there.

::

    $ make deb
    $ make install_deb

Open ``http://localhost:8000`` and follow on-boarding tutorial.

.. note:: Building ``deb`` package calls ``make distclean``, which will zap your development
          configuration. Build outside devel environment if you want to preserve your config.

The package needs virtually zero configuration:

- ``deb`` is self-deployable
- installs into ``/srv/openvpnathome``
- Python3 virtual environment, static files, etc are all in the ``deb`` package
- ``systemd`` service script ``openvpnathome.service`` is installed and starts by default
- ``uwsgi`` runs on ``http://127.0.0.1:8000``
- Contains bootstrapping script to automate app configuration

Building a package will call ``sudo`` and ask you for a password. Root privileges are required
in Python's virtual environment installation step, as we must ``sudo mount -o bind ...`` and
``sudo umount ...`` virtualenv destination directory. Unfortunately, Python 3 virtualenv
relocation is not reliable (and discouraged), so we decided to hack during the build process
rather than at runtime. Refer to ``Makefile`` ``install`` target.

.. note:: If ``make deb`` fails for whatever reason, make sure ``/srv/openvpnathome`` is left unmounted.

Configuration
-------------

If ``make devel`` was run, the app is up and running in development mode with default development
configuration:

- Admin login is *admin@locahost*
- Admin password is *admin1234*
- Database is located in ``${PROJECT_ROOT}/db/db.sqlite3``
- Settings have ``development`` flag set to true ``true``

App config
~~~~~~~~~~

Configuration is loaded from ``settings.json`` located in deployment directory. Settings file must be generated first.

::

    (virtuanenv) $ ./backend/manage.py configure [--accept] [--devel] [--help]

Once the file is generated, you must accept it by flipping a ``configured`` flag inside.

.. note:: ``settings.json`` is excluded from Git repository, so you can safely put your real e-mail credentials there.

You can also access **Django Admin** app, which is left enabled.

OpenVPN config
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

OpenVPN configuration is generated from templates in ``openvpnathome.apps.openvpn.templates``. If the default
configuration doesn't suit your needs, you can alter templates directly there.

There is no frontend config editor, although I was thinking about it.

Development
===========

Want to jump in? Fantastic.

I made it as easy to start development as possible. Top-level project directory contains 2 subprojects:
``backend`` and ``frontend``.

Top-level ``Makefile`` delegates targets to sub-projects and is provided for convenience. Once ``make devel`` is
done, you can work inside individual subproject with your favorite IDE.

I personally use *JetBrains WebStorm* and *PyCharm*, but you can use whatever you want.
IDE files are not even in the repo.

Backend subproject
------------------

This is the **Django** app. Mostly REST API + single frontend serving view.
App modules have brief documentation inside ``__init__.py``. Docs are kept up-to-date, as I strongly
believe in code documentation.

Provided ``Makefile``'s default target displays help:

::

    $ make
    Welcome to OpenVPN@Home make system

    Available targets:
     * devel      - boostrap project for development (your first choice)
     * virtualenv - install virtual environment and all dependencies
     * runserver  - start development server
     * test       - run full test suite

In development mode, frontend files are stored outside of this project, in ``frontend`` subproject. **Django** app
will pick static and templates from frontend build directory.

When development mode is off, frontend resources are taken from ``openvpnathome.apps.frontend`` app.

**Django Debug Toolbar** is provided by default, should you need to check which templates are picked up.

Frontend subproject
-------------------

Frontend sub-project contains **Vue.js** SPA served by **Django**.

Provided ``Makefile``'s default target displays help:

::

    $ cd frontend
    $ make
    Welcome to OpenVPN@Home make system - frontend sub-project
    You need running node.js and npm.

    Available targets:
     * build-prod  - build production build; backend project is NOT updated
     * build-devel - watch and make development build on change; output written to './dist'
     * install     - install packages from package.json
     * distclean   - clean project, delete all data (start from 'git clone' state)

This is pretty self-explanatory too. When developing front-end code, you run **Django** app in development mode,
and ``make build-devel``.

**Django** will pick frontend code from ``frontend/dist`` directory.

**Django** injects some initial state via ``<script>...</script>`` tag. See ``index.html`` and ``openvpnathome.apps.frontent.views`` for
details.

Known issues
============

I left this as the last point, hoping not to scare anybody.

 * only one sever can be managed (I don't need more for now)
 * frontend has 0% test coverage and many lint issues :o)
 * security is not a major concern for this app, I'm not running a CA company
 * no real user management - I rely on Django Admin panel for it
 * not tested on Windows, as I don't touch it even with a 10-foot stick, in rubber gloves - patches are welcome, however
 * no cert revocation (yet)
 * no automatic OpenVPN configuration (yet)
